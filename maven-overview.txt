Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. 
- Required Java 7
- POM: Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.
- Maven to handle enterprise level Java projects development. So it is beneficial to have the knowledge of software development, Java SE, overview of Java EE development and deployment process.
- provides developers ways to manage the following −
    Builds
    Documentation
    Reporting
    Dependencies
    SCMs
    Releases
    Distribution
    Mailing list
- Maven uses Convention over Configuration, which means developers are not required to create build process themselves.
  source code	${basedir}/src/main/java
  Resources	${basedir}/src/main/resources
  Tests	${basedir}/src/test
  Complied byte code	${basedir}/target
  distributable JAR	${basedir}/target/classes
- Features of Maven
    Simple project setup that follows best practices.
    Consistent usage across all projects.
    Dependency management including automatic updating.
    A large and growing repository of libraries.
    Extensible, with the ability to easily write plugins in Java or scripting languages.
    Instant access to new features with little or no extra configuration.
    Model-based builds − Maven is able to build any number of projects into predefined output types such as jar, war, metadata.
    Coherent site of project information − Using the same metadata as per the build process, maven is able to generate a website and a PDF including complete documentation.
    Release management and distribution publication − Without additional configuration, maven will integrate with your source control system such as CVS and manages the release of a project.  
    Backward Compatibility − You can easily port the multiple modules of a project into Maven 3 from older versions of Maven. It can support the older versions also.
  Automatic parent versioning − No need to specify the parent in the sub module for maintenance.
  Parallel builds − It analyzes the project dependency graph and enables you to build schedule modules in parallel. Using this, you can achieve the performance improvements of 20-50%.

Better Error and Integrity Reporting − Maven improved error reporting, and it provides you with a link to the Maven wiki page where you will get full description of the error.
